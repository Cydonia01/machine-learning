# Model Selection and Evaluation

This directory contains scripts for model selection and evaluation, including grid search and other selection techniques for machine learning models.

---

## 1. Model Selection with Grid Search

Grid search is used to systematically work through multiple combinations of parameter values, cross-validating as it goes to determine the best model configuration.

### Typical Workflow

- Define a model (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
- Specify a parameter grid to search
- Use `GridSearchCV` from scikit-learn to perform the search
- Evaluate the best model on a test set

## 2. General Model Selection Script

This folder may also include scripts for comparing multiple models, evaluating performance metrics, and selecting the best model based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or other criteria.

### Example Steps

- Train multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
- Evaluate each model using cross-validation
- Compare results and select the best-performing model

## Requirements

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

Install with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
