# Model Selection and Evaluation

This directory contains scripts for model selection and evaluation, including grid search and other selection techniques for machine learning models.

## 1. Model Selection with Grid Search

Grid search is used to systematically work through multiple combinations of parameter values, cross-validating as it goes to determine the best model configuration.

### Typical Workflow

- Define a model (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
- Specify a parameter grid to search
- Use `GridSearchCV` from scikit-learn to perform the search
- Evaluate the best model on a test set

### Example Usage

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Define model and parameter grid
model = SVC()
param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']}

# Grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

print('Best parameters:', grid_search.best_params_)
print('Best cross-validation score:', grid_search.best_score_)
```

## 2. General Model Selection Script

This folder may also include scripts for comparing multiple models, evaluating performance metrics, and selecting the best model based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or other criteria.

### Example Steps

- Train multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
- Evaluate each model using cross-validation
- Compare results and select the best-performing model

## Requirements

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

Install with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
